# FYP-Google-Maps
Workbenches on Google Maps

To run the application, first run mongod.exe from the cmd. Then run node server.js from the main folder. 
Then open a browser and go to localhost http://localhost:2001/. To see the locations go to http://localhost:2001/users.
To add more locations I used Google Postman, and posted the new location to http://localhost:2001/users in json format.
